Air-Typing Virtual Keyboard (Prototype)

I made this Python-based virtual keyboard that lets you type in the air using hand gestures via OpenCV (no Mediapipe).  
Finger pointing moves the cursor, palm open hovers/selects, and a fist presses keys.  
Still under training  this is just a prototype, so expect more upgrades soon.

How it Works

- **virtual_keyboard.py** â†’ The main logic for webcam capture, hand detection, gesture recognition, and virtual keyboard rendering.
- **config.py** â†’ Change this if you want to adjust camera index, detection thresholds, keyboard size, debounce timing, etc.

  Gestures

- Finger Pointing â†’ Move cursor over virtual keys.
- Palm Open â†’ Hover/select mode.
- Fist (Palm Closed) â†’ Press the selected key.
- Both Palms Up â†’ Exit the program.

 Notes
- This is a **prototype**, so detection accuracy and gesture recognition are still under development.
- Works best in well-lit environments with clear hand visibility.
